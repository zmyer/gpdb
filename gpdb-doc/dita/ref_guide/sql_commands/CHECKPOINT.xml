so often. The automatic checkpoint interval is set per Greenplum Database
segment instance by the server configuration parameters <varname>checkpoint_segments</varname>
and <varname>checkpoint_timeout</varname>. The <codeph>CHECKPOINT</codeph> command
forces an immediate checkpoint when the command is issued, without waiting
for a scheduled checkpoint. </p><p>A checkpoint is a point in the transaction log sequence at which all
data files have been updated to reflect the information in the log. All
data files will be flushed to disk.</p><p>Only superusers may call <codeph>CHECKPOINT</codeph>. The command
is not intended for use during normal operation.</p></section><section id="section4"><title>Compatibility</title><p>The <codeph>CHECKPOINT</codeph> command is a Greenplum Database language
extension.</p></section></body></topic>

  <title id="kk155429">Backing Up Greenplum Databases</title>
  <shortdesc>This topic describes backup options for Greenplum Databases.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>You can use different methods to back up your Greenplum databases, depending on the purpose
      of the backup. Every production database should have in place a backup strategy to ensure that
      the database can be restored in case of disaster. Routine backups should use a method that
      takes advantage of Greenplum parallelism, for example the <codeph>gpcrondump</codeph> utility. </p>
    <p>You can also use a third-party backup solution, such as Dell EMC Data Domain Boost or Veritas
      NetBackup with <codeph>gpcrondump</codeph> to backup and restore Greenplum Database. </p>
    <p>Backups can be used for purposes other than disaster recovery, such as migrating data from
      one Greenplum database to another Greenplum database, or migrating a database to or from a
      different database system. These may be one-time tasks or part of your regular business
      process. Depending on requirements, you can use tools such as the standard PostgreSQL backup
      utilities, the <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> utility, or the SQL <codeph>COPY TO</codeph>
      command.</p>

  <body>
    <p>How you restore a database from parallel backup files depends on how you answer the following
      questions.</p>
    <ol>
      <li id="kk156235"><b>Where are your backup files?</b> If your backup files are on the segment
        hosts where <codeph>gpcrondump</codeph> created them, you can restore the database with
          <codeph>gpdbrestore</codeph>. If you moved your backup files away from the Greenplum
        array, for example to an archive server with <codeph>gpcrondump</codeph>, use
          <codeph>gpdbrestore</codeph>.</li>
      <li id="kk156245"><b>Are you recreating the Greenplum Database system, or just restoring your
          data? </b>If Greenplum Database is running and you are restoring your data, use
          <codeph>gpdbrestore</codeph>. If you lost your entire array and need to rebuild the entire
        system from backup, use <codeph>gpinitsystem</codeph>.</li>
      <li id="kk156252"><b>Are you restoring to a system with the same number of segment instances
          as your backup set?</b> If you are restoring to an array with the same number of segment
        hosts and segment instances per host, use <codeph>gpdbrestore</codeph>. If you are migrating
        to a different array configuration, you must do a non-parallel restore. See <xref
          href="restore-diff-system.xml" type="topic" format="dita"/>.</li>

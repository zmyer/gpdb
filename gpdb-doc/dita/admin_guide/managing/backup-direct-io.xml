  <title>Using Direct I/O</title>
  <body>
    <p>The operating system normally caches file I/O operations in memory because memory access is
      much faster than disk access. The application writes to a block of memory that is later
      flushed to the storage device, which is usually a RAID controller in a Greenplum Database
      system. Whenever the application accesses a block that is still resident in memory, a device
      access is avoided. Direct I/O allows you to bypass the cache so that the application writes
      directly to the storage device. This reduces CPU consumption and eliminates a data copy
      operation. Direct I/O is efficient for operations like backups where file blocks are only
      handled once.</p>
    <note>Direct I/O is supported only on Red Hat, CentOS, and SUSE.</note>

      <title>Turning on Direct I/O</title>
      <p>Set the <codeph>gp_backup_directIO</codeph> system configuration parameter on to enable
        direct I/O for backups:<codeblock>$ gpconfig -c gp_backup_directIO -v on</codeblock></p>
      <p>To see if direct I/O is enabled, use this command:
        <codeblock>$ gpconfig -s gp_backup_directIO</codeblock></p>

      <title>Decrease network data chunks sent to dump when the database is busy</title>
      <p>The <codeph>gp_backup_directIO_read_chunk_mb</codeph> configuration parameter sets the
        size, in MB, of the I/O chunk when direct I/O is enabled. The default chunk size, 20MB, has
        been tested and found to be optimal. Decreasing it increases the backup time and increasing
        it results in little change to backup time. </p>
      <p>To find the current direct I/O chunk size, enter this command:</p>
      <codeblock>$ gpconfig -s gp_backup_directIO_read_chunk_mb</codeblock>
      <p>The following example changes the default chunk size to 10MB.</p>
      <codeblock>$ gpconfig -c gp_backup_directIO_read_chunk_mb -v 10</codeblock>

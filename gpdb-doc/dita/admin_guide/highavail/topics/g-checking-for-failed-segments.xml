  <title>Checking for Failed Segments</title>
  <body>
    <p>With mirroring enabled, you may have failed segments in the system without interruption of
      service or any indication that a failure has occurred. You can verify the status of your
      system using the <codeph>gpstate</codeph> utility. <codeph>gpstate</codeph> provides the
      status of each individual component of a Greenplum Database system, including
      primary segments, mirror segments, master, and standby master.</p>

      <title>To check for failed segments</title>
      <ol>
        <li id="ki155584">On the master, run the <codeph>gpstate</codeph> utility with the
            <codeph>-e</codeph> option to show segments with error conditions:<codeblock>$ gpstate -e</codeblock>
          <p>Segments in <i>Change Tracking</i> mode indicate the corresponding mirror segment is
            down. When a segment is not in its <i>preferred role</i>, the segment does not operate
            in the role to which it was assigned at system initialization. This means the system is
            in a potentially unbalanced state, as some segment hosts may have more active segments
            than is optimal for top system performance.</p>
          <p>See <xref href="g-recovering-from-segment-failures.xml#topic14"
            /> for instructions to fix this situation.</p>

        <li id="ki165350">To get detailed information about a failed segment, check the
            <i>gp_segment_configuration</i> catalog table. For
          example:<codeblock>$ psql -c "SELECT * FROM gp_segment_configuration WHERE status='d';"</codeblock>
        </li>
        <li id="ki162539">For failed segment instances, note the host, port, preferred role, and
          data directory. This information will help determine the host and segment instances to
          troubleshoot.</li>
        <li id="ki155591">To show information about mirror segment instances,

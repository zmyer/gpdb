   <title>Identifying Invalid CSV Files in Error Table Data</title>
   <body>
      <p>If a CSV file contains invalid formatting, the <i>rawdata</i> field in the error table can
      contain several combined rows. For example, if a closing quote for a specific field is
      missing, all the following newlines are treated as embedded newlines. When this happens,
        Greenplum stops parsing a row when it reaches 64K, puts that
      64K of data into the error table as a single row, resets the quote flag, and continues. If
      this happens three times during load processing, the load file is considered invalid and the
      entire load fails with the message "<codeph>rejected </codeph>
      <codeph>N</codeph>
      <codeph> or more rows</codeph>". See <xref
        href="g-escaping-in-csv-formatted-files.xml#topic101"/> for more information on the correct
      use of quotes in CSV files.</p>

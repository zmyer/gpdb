   <body>
      <p>
            <cmdname>gpfdist</cmdname> is installed in <codeph>$GPHOME/bin</codeph> of your Greenplum Database master host installation. Run <cmdname>gpfdist</cmdname>
            from a machine other than the Greenplum Database master, such as on a
            machine devoted to ETL processing. If you want to install <cmdname>gpfdist</cmdname> on
            your ETL server, get it from the <i>Greenplum Load Tools</i> package and follow its
            installation instructions.</p>

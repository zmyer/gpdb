  <title>Working with File-Based External Tables</title>
  <body>
    <p>External tables provide access to data stored in data sources outside of Greenplum Database as if the data were stored in regular database tables. Data can be
      read from or written to external tables.</p>
    <p>An external table is a Greenplum database table backed with data
      that resides outside of the database. An external table is either readable or writable. It can
      be used like a regular database table in SQL commands such as <codeph>SELECT</codeph> and
        <codeph>INSERT</codeph> and joined with other tables. External tables are most often used to
      load and unload database data. </p>
    <p>Web-based external tables provide access to data served by an HTTP server or an operating
      system process. See <xref href="g-creating-and-using-web-external-tables.xml#topic31"/> for
      more about web-based tables. </p>

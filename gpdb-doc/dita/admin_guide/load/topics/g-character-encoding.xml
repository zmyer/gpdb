  <title>Character Encoding</title>
  <body>
    <p>Character encoding systems consist of a code that pairs each character from a character set
      with something else, such as a sequence of numbers or octets, to facilitate data stransmission
      and storage. Greenplum Database supports a variety of character sets, including
      single-byte character sets such as the ISO 8859 series and multiple-byte character sets such
      as EUC (Extended UNIX Code), UTF-8, and Mule internal code. Clients can use all supported
      character sets transparently, but a few are not supported for use within the server as a
      server-side encoding.</p>
    <p>Data files must be in a character encoding recognized by Greenplum Database.
        <ph>See the <i>Greenplum Database Reference Guide</i> for the supported
        character sets. </ph>Data files that contain invalid or unsupported encoding sequences
      encounter errors when loading into Greenplum Database.</p>
    <note type="note">On data files generated on a Microsoft Windows operating system, run the
        <codeph>dos2unix</codeph> system command to remove any Windows-only characters before
      loading into Greenplum Database.</note>

  <title>Migrating Data with Gptransfer</title>
  <body>
    <p>The <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> migration utility transfers Greenplum Database metadata and
      data from one Greenplum database to another Greenplum database, allowing you to migrate the
      entire contents of a database, or just selected tables, to another database. The source and
      destination databases may be in the same or a different cluster. <codeph>gptransfer</codeph>
      moves data in parallel across all the segments, using the <codeph>gpfdist</codeph> data
      loading utility to attain the highest transfer rates. </p>
    <p><codeph>gptransfer</codeph> handles the setup and execution of the data transfer.
      Participating clusters must already exist, have network access between all hosts in both
      clusters, and have certificate-authenticated ssh access between all hosts in both clusters. </p>
    <p>The <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> interface includes options to transfer one or more full
      databases, or one or more database tables. A full database transfer includes the database
      schema, table data, indexes, views, roles, user-defined functions, and resource queues.
      Configuration files, including <codeph>postgres.conf</codeph> and
      <codeph>pg_hba.conf</codeph>, must be transferred manually by an administrator. Extensions
      installed in the database with <codeph>gppkg</codeph>, such as MADlib and programming language
      extensions, must be installed in the destination database by an administrator. </p>
    <section>
      <title>What gptransfer Does</title>
      <p><codeph>gptransfer</codeph> uses writable and readable external tables, the Greenplum
          <codeph>gpfdist</codeph> parallel data-loading utility, and named pipes to transfer data
        from the source database to the destination database. Segments on the source cluster select
        from the source database table and insert into a writable external table. Segments in the
        destination cluster select from a readable external table and insert into the destination
        database table. The writable and readable external tables are backed by named pipes on the
        source cluster's segment hosts, and each named pipe has a <codeph>gpfdist</codeph> process
        serving the pipe's output to the readable external table on the destination segments. </p>
      <p><codeph>gptransfer</codeph> orchestrates the process by processing the database objects to
        be transferred in batches. For each table to be transferred, it performs the following
          tasks:<ul id="ul_wsd_4tg_dp">
          <li>creates a writable external table in the source database</li>
          <li>creates a readable external table in the destination database</li>
          <li>creates named pipes and <codeph>gpfdist</codeph> processes on segment hosts in the
            source cluster</li>
          <li>executes a <codeph>SELECT INTO</codeph> statement in the source database to insert the
            source data into the writable external table</li>
          <li>executes a <codeph>SELECT INTO</codeph> statement in the destination database to
            insert the data from the readable external table into the destination table</li>
          <li>optionally validates the data by comparing row counts or MD5 hashes of the rows in the
            source and destination</li>
          <li>cleans up the external tables, named pipes, and <codeph>gpfdist</codeph>
            processes</li>
        </ul></p>

      <title>Prerequisites</title>
      <ul id="ul_wkb_xqd_cp">
        <li>The <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> utility can only be used with Greenplum Database,
          including the Dell EMC DCA appliance. Pivotal HAWQ is not supported as a source or destination. </li>
        <li>The source and destination Greenplum clusters must both be version 4.2 or higher.</li>
        <li>At least one Greenplum instance must include the <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> utility in
          its distribution. The utility is included with Greenplum Database version 4.2.8.1 and
          higher and 4.3.2.0 and higher. If neither the source or destination includes
            <codeph>gptransfer</codeph>, you must upgrade one of the clusters to use
            <codeph>gptransfer</codeph>. </li>
        <li>The <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> utility can be run from the cluster with the source or
          destination database.</li>
        <li>The number of <i>segments</i> in the destination cluster must be greater than or equal
          to the number of <i>hosts</i> in the source cluster. The number of segments in the
          destination may be smaller than the number of segments in the source, but the data will
          transfer at a slower rate.</li>
        <li>The segment hosts in both clusters must have network connectivity with each other.</li>
        <li>Every host in both clusters must be able to connect to every other host with
          certificate-authenticated SSH. You can use the <codeph>gpssh_exkeys</codeph> utility to
          exchange public keys between the hosts of both clusters.</li>
      </ul>

    <section>
      <title>Fast Mode and Slow Mode</title>
      <p><codeph>gptransfer</codeph> sets up data transfer using the <codeph>gpfdist</codeph>
        parallel file serving utility, which serves the data evenly to the destination segments.
        Running more <codeph>gpfdist</codeph> processes increases the parallelism and the data
        transfer rate. When the destination cluster has the same or a greater number of segments
        than the source cluster, <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> sets up one named pipe and one
          <codeph>gpfdist</codeph> process for each source segment. This is the configuration for
        optimal data transfer rates and is called <i>fast mode</i>. </p>
      <p>The configuration of the input end of the named pipes differs when there are fewer segments
        in the destination cluster than in the source cluster. <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> handles
        this alternative setup automatically. The difference in configuration means that
        transferring data into a destination cluster with fewer segments than the source cluster is
        not as fast as transferring into a destination cluster of the same or greater size. It is
        called <i>slow mode</i> because there are fewer <codeph>gpfdist</codeph> processes serving
        the data to the destination cluster, although the transfer is still quite fast with one
          <codeph>gpfdist</codeph> per segment host.</p>
      <p>When the destination cluster is smaller than the source cluster, there is one named pipe
        per segment host and all segments on the host send their data through it. The segments on
        the source host write their data to a writable web external table connected to a
          <codeph>gpfdist</codeph> process on the input end of the named pipe. This consolidates the
        table data into a single named pipe. A <codeph>gpfdist</codeph> process on the output of the
        named pipe serves the consolidated data to the destination cluster. </p>
      <p>On the destination side, <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> defines a readable external table with
        the <codeph>gpfdist</codeph> server on the source host as input and selects from the
        readable external table into the destination table. The data is distributed evenly to all
        the segments in the destination cluster. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Batch Size and Sub-batch Size</title>
      <p>The degree of parallelism of a <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> execution is determined by two
        command-line options: <codeph>--batch-size</codeph> and <codeph>--sub-batch-size</codeph>.
        The <codeph>--batch-size</codeph> option specifies the number of tables to transfer in a
        batch. The default batch size is 2, which means that two table transfers are in process at
        any time. The minimum batch size is 1 and the maximum is 10. The
          <codeph>--sub-batch-size</codeph> parameter specifies the maximum number of parallel
        sub-processes to start to do the work of transferring a table. The default is 25 and the
        maximum is 50. The product of the batch size and sub-batch size is the amount of
        parallelism. If set to the defaults, for example, <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> can perform 50
        concurrent tasks. Each thread is a Python process and consumes memory, so setting these
        values too high can cause a Python Out of Memory error. For this reason, the batch sizes
        should be tuned for your environment. </p>

      <title>Preparing Hosts for gptransfer</title>
      <p>When you install a Greenplum Database cluster, you set up all the master and segment hosts
        so that the Greenplum Database administrative user (<codeph>gpadmin</codeph>) can connect
        with ssh from every host in the cluster to any other host in the cluster without providing a
        password. The <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> utility requires this capability between every
        host in the source and destination clusters. First, ensure that the clusters have network
        connectivity with each other. Then, prepare a hosts file containing a list of all the hosts
        in both clusters, and use the <codeph>gpssh-exkeys</codeph> utility to exchange keys. See
        the reference for <codeph>gpssh-exkeys</codeph> in the <i>Greenplum Database Utility
          Guide</i>.</p>
      <p>The host map file is a text file that lists the segment hosts in the source cluster. It is
        used to enable communication between the hosts in Greenplum clusters. The file is specified
        on the <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> command line with the
            <codeph>--source-map-file=<i>host_map_file</i></codeph> command option. It is a required
        option when using <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> to copy data between two separate Greenplum
        clusters.</p>
      <p>The file contains a list in the following
        format:<codeblock>host1_name,host1_ip_addr
host2_name,host2_ipaddr
...</codeblock>The file
        uses IP addresses instead of host names to avoid any problems with name resolution between
        the clusters. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Limitations</title>
      <p><codeph>gptransfer</codeph> transfers data from user databases only; the
          <codeph>postgres</codeph>, <codeph>template0</codeph>, and <codeph>template1</codeph>
        databases cannot be transferred. Administrators must transfer configuration files manually
        and install extensions into the destination database with <codeph>gppkg</codeph>.</p>
      <p>The destination cluster must have at least as many segments as the source cluster has
        segment hosts. Transferring data to a smaller cluster is not as fast as transferring data to
        a larger cluster. </p>
      <p>Transferring small or empty tables can be unexpectedly slow. There is significant fixed
        overhead in setting up external tables and communications processes for parallel data
        loading between segments that occurs whether or not there is actual data to transfer.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Full Mode and Table Mode</title>
      <p>When run with the <codeph>--full</codeph> option, <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> copies all
        tables, views, indexes, roles, user-defined functions, and resource queues in the source
        database to the destination database. Databases to be transferred must not already exist on
        the destination cluster. If <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> finds the database on the
        destination it fails with a message like the
        following:<codeblock>[ERROR]:- gptransfer: error: --full option specified but tables exist on destination system</codeblock></p>
      <p>To copy tables individually, specify the tables using either the <codeph>-t</codeph>
        command-line option (one option per table) or by using the <codeph>-f</codeph> command-line
        option to specify a file containing a list of tables to transfer. Tables are specified in
        the fully-qualified format <codeph><i>database</i>.<i>schema</i>.<i>table</i></codeph>. The
        table definition, indexes, and table data are copied. The database must already exist on the
        destination cluster.</p>
      <p>By default, <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> fails if you attempt to transfer a table that
        already exists in the destination database:</p>
      <codeblock>[INFO]:-Validating transfer table set...
[CRITICAL]:- gptransfer failed. (Reason='Table <i>database.schema.table</i> exists in database <i>database</i> .') exiting...</codeblock>
      <p>Override this behavior with the <codeph>--skip-existing</codeph>,
          <codeph>--truncate</codeph>, or <codeph>--drop</codeph> options.</p>
      <p>The following table shows the objects that are copied in full mode and table mode.</p>

      <p>The <codeph>--full</codeph> option and the <codeph>--schema-only</codeph> option can be
        used together if you want to copy a database in phases, for example, during scheduled
        periods of downtime or low activity. Run <codeph>gptransfer --full --schema-only -d
            <i>&lt;database_name></i> ...</codeph> to create the full database on the destination
        cluster, but with no data. Then you can transfer the tables in stages during scheduled down
        times or periods of low activity. Be sure to include the <codeph>--truncate</codeph> or
          <codeph>--drop</codeph> option when you later transfer tables to prevent the transfer from
        failing because the table already exists at the destination.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Locking</title>
      <p>The <codeph>-x</codeph> option enables table locking. An exclusive lock is placed on the
        source table until the copy and validation, if requested, are complete. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Validation</title>
      <p>By default, <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> does not validate the data transferred. You can
        request validation using the <codeph>--validate=<i>type</i></codeph> option. The validation
          <i>type</i> can be one of the following:<ul id="ul_lqh_wnh_dp">
          <li><codeph>count</codeph> &#8211; Compares the row counts for the tables in the source
            and destination databases. </li>
          <li><codeph>md5</codeph> &#8211; Sorts tables on both source and destination, and then
            performs a row-by-row comparison of the MD5 hashes of the sorted rows.</li>
        </ul></p>
      <p>If the database is accessible during the transfer, be sure to add the <codeph>-x</codeph>
        option to lock the table. Otherwise, the table could be modified during the transfer,
        causing validation to fail.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Failed Transfers</title>
      <p>A failure on a table does not end the <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> job. When a transfer
        fails, <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> displays an error message and adds the table name to a
        failed transfers file. At the end of the <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> session,
          <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> writes a message telling you there were failures, and
        providing the name of the failed transfer file. For
        example:<codeblock>[WARNING]:-Some tables failed to transfer. A list of these tables
[WARNING]:-has been written to the file failed_transfer_tables_20140808_101813.txt
[WARNING]:-This file can be used with the -f option to continue</codeblock></p>
      <p>The failed transfers file is in the format required by the <codeph>-f</codeph> option, so
        you can use it to start a new <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> session to retry the failed
        transfers.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Best Practices</title>
      <p><codeph>gptransfer</codeph> creates a configuration that allows transferring large amounts
        of data at very high rates. For small or empty tables, however, the
          <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> set up and clean up are too expensive. The best practice is to
        use <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> for large tables and to use other methods for copying
        smaller tables. </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Before you begin to transfer data, replicate the schema or schemas from the source
          cluster to the destination cluster. Do not use <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> with the
            <codeph>--full –schema-only</codeph> options. Here are some options for copying the
            schema:<ul id="ul_q1y_1hh_1s">
            <li>Use the <codeph>gpsd</codeph> (Greenplum Statistics Dump) support utility. This
              method includes statistics, so be sure to run <codeph>ANALYZE</codeph> after creating
              the schema on the destination cluster.</li>
            <li>Use the PostgreSQL <codeph>pg_dump</codeph> or <codeph>pg_dumpall</codeph> utility
              with the <codeph>–schema-only</codeph> option.</li>
            <li>DDL scripts, or any other method for recreating schema in the destination
              database.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Divide the non-empty tables to be transferred into large and small categories, using
          criteria of your own choice. For example, you could decide large tables have more than one
          million rows or a raw data size greater than 1GB. </li>
        <li>Transfer data for small tables using the SQL <codeph>COPY</codeph> command. This
          eliminates the warm-up/cool-down time each table incurs when using the
            <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> utility.<ul id="ul_ih2_dqm_1s">
            <li>Optionally, write or reuse existing shell scripts to loop through a list of table
              names to copy with the <codeph>COPY</codeph> command.</li>
          </ul></li>
        <li>Use <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> to transfer the large table data in batches of
            tables.<ul id="ul_h1z_pqm_1s">
            <li>It is best to transfer to the same size cluster or to a larger cluster so that
                <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> runs in fast mode. </li>
            <li>If any indexes exist, drop them before starting the transfer process.</li>
            <li>Use the <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> table (<codeph>-t</codeph>) or file
                (<codeph>-f</codeph>) options to execute the migration in batches of tables. Do not
              run <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> using the full mode; the schema and smaller tables
              have already been transferred.</li>
            <li>Perform test runs of the <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> process before the production
              migration. This ensures tables can be transferred successfully. You can experiment
              with the <codeph>--batch-size</codeph> and <codeph>--sub-batch-size</codeph> options
              to obtain maximum parallelism. Determine proper batching of tables for iterative
                <codeph>gptransfer</codeph> runs.</li>
            <li>Include the <codeph>--skip-existing</codeph> option because the schema already
              exists on the destination cluster.</li>
            <li>Use only fully qualified table names. Be aware that periods (.), whitespace, quotes
              (') and double quotes (") in table names may cause problems. </li>
            <li>If you decide to use the <codeph>--validation</codeph> option to validate the data
              after transfer, be sure to also use the <codeph>-x</codeph> option to place an
              exclusive lock on the source table.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>After all tables are transferred, perform the following tasks:<ul id="ul_dgz_f5m_1s">
            <li>Check for and correct any failed transfers.</li>
            <li>Recreate the indexes that were dropped before the transfer. </li>
            <li>Ensure any roles, functions, and resource queues are created in the destination
              database. These objects are not transferred when you use the <codeph>gptransfer

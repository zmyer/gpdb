  <title>About this Documentation</title>
  <body>
    <p>Source code for the Greenplum Database documentation is shared between Greenplum Database and
      Pivotal Greenplum Database. Some features of Pivotal Greenplum Database are not present in the
      open source Greenplum Database code but are described in the Greenplum Database documentation. </p>
    <p>In general, the term "Pivotal Greenplum Database" refers to Pivotal's commercial, supported
      version of Greenplum Database and is used in this documentation when describing features that
      are only supported in the commercial Greenplum Database software. The term "Greenplum
      Database" refers to features available in both open source Greenplum Database and Pivotal
      Greenplum Database. </p>
    <p>Features that are only supported with Pivotal Greenplum Database are noted in sections that
      contain primary documentation for the features. </p>
    <p>The following is a list of Pivotal Greenplum Database features that are unsupported in open
      source Greenplum Database but may be documented or referenced in this documentation.</p>
    <ul id="ul_grq_1wg_q5">

        in the open source Greenplum Database repository. </li>

          <codeph>SELECT</codeph> operations on the table.</li>
      <li>The deprecated <codeph>gpcheck</codeph> management utility and its replacement

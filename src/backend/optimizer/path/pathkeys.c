 *
 * 1. If the new pathkey's equivalence class contains a constant, and isn't
 * below an outer join, then we can disregard it as a sort key.  An example:
 *			SELECT ... WHERE x = 42 ORDER BY x, y;
 * We may as well just sort by y.  Note that because of opfamily matching,
 * this is semantically correct: we know that the equality constraint is one
 * that actually binds the variable to a single value in the terms of any
 * ordering operator that might go with the eclass.  This rule not only lets
 * us simplify (or even skip) explicit sorts, but also allows matching index
 * sort orders to a query when there are don't-care index columns.
 *
 * 2. If the new pathkey's equivalence class is the same as that of any
 * existing member of the pathkey list, then it is redundant.  Some examples:
 *			SELECT ... ORDER BY x, x;
 *			SELECT ... ORDER BY x, x DESC;
 *			SELECT ... WHERE x = y ORDER BY x, y;
 * In all these cases the second sort key cannot distinguish values that are
 * considered equal by the first, and so there's no point in using it.
 * Note in particular that we need not compare opfamily (all the opfamilies
 * of the EC have the same notion of equality) nor sort direction.
 *
 * Because the equivclass.c machinery forms only one copy of any EC per query,
 * pointer comparison is enough to decide whether canonical ECs are the same.

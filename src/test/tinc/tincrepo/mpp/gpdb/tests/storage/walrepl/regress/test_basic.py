        Test to verify if TLI mismatch issue during Pass 3 of xlog record

        the other when replayed on the standby and then if the 
        standby is promoted, it should go through the prmotion just fine.

        The flow of this test is as follows.
        1. Initiate the Standby using the Master (primary) postmaster
           paramerters.
        2. Perform explicit checkpoints and wait so that they get replicated.
        3. Then promote the standby, wait and then try to access it.
        4. If we can successfuly access it, its a Pass otherwise a Fail.

Running workload parallely through ScenarioTestCase framework can
reduce the total amount of time, however, when vacuum full is also
being executed at the same time, it can cause deadlock problem.

In addition, concurrently alterring same relation is not allowed.

Therefore, this part is to run such workload in sequential way.

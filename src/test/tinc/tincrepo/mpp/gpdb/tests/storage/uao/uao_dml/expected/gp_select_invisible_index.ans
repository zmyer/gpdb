-- @Description Tests that gp_select_invisible is working correctly on AO tables
-- with an index.

-- Force the usage of the index
SET enable_seqscan=false;
SET
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM foo WHERE a < 4;
 count 
-------
     3
(1 row)

DELETE FROM foo WHERE a < 4;
DELETE 3
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM foo WHERE a < 4;
 count 
-------
     0
(1 row)

SET gp_select_invisible=true;
SET
-- Should display all tuples
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM foo WHERE a < 4;
 count 
-------
     3
(1 row)

-- Now an interesting case where we update with gp_select_invisible active
UPDATE foo SET b = 0 WHERE a < 5;
UPDATE 1
-- We should not re-activate the deleted tuples
SET gp_select_invisible=false;
SET
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM foo WHERE b = 0;
 count 
-------
     1
(1 row)

-- Now the same re-activation test with update

UPDATE foo SET b = -1 WHERE a = 4;
UPDATE 1
SET gp_select_invisible=false;
SET
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM foo WHERE a = 4;

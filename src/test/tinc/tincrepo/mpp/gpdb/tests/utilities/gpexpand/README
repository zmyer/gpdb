## Tests for gpexpand utility

### Prerequisites:

- GPDB binaries installed on the host where the tests are running. Note that we need not
have an initialized cluster as the tests take care of initializing a required cluster

- GPDB binaries installed on all the hosts involved in the expansion tests.

- HOST\[N] environment variables need to be set, e.g. 
```sh
export HOST1=test1 HOST2=test2 HOST3=test3 HOST4=test4 HOST5=test5
```

- PGDATABASE environment variable set to a valid database, e.g.
```sh
export PGDATABASE=gptest
```

- source the greenplum installation env vars and the tinc environment variables
```bash
source $INSTALLDIR/greenplum_path.sh # where INSTALLDIR is where greenplum was installed
source src/test/tinc/tinc_env.sh
```

### How to run:

From this folder as current working directory, do
```sh
tinc.py discover .

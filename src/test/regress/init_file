# There are a number of NOTICE and HINT messages around table distribution,
# for example to inform the user that the database will pick a particular
# column in order to distribute the data. Merging tests from postgres will
# cause the tests to output these messages and we would need to manually
# modify the corresponding expected output. Hence we want to ignore these.
# Some of the messages include:
#
# NOTICE:  Table doesn't have 'DISTRIBUTED BY' clause -- Using column named '<colname>' as the Greenplum Database data distribution key for this table.
# NOTICE:  Table doesn't have 'DISTRIBUTED BY' clause, defaulting to distribution columns from LIKE table
# HINT:  The 'DISTRIBUTED BY' clause determines the distribution of data. Make sure column(s) chosen are the optimal data distribution key to minimize skew.
#
# The following regex is intended to cover all permutations of the above set
# of messages.
m/^(?:HINT|NOTICE):\s+.+\'DISTRIBUTED BY\' clause.*/

# The following NOTICE is generated when a partitioned table is created. For
# each child partition that gets created, it will generate a NOTICE saying that
# it is creating that particular partition. Certain tests add anonymous
# partitions and the names of these anonymous partitions will change across test
# runs.
# E.g CREATE TABLE will create partition "hhh_1_prt_r1987544232" for table "hhh" 
#     CREATE TABLE will create partition "hhh_1_prt_r1987553186" for table "hhh"
m/^NOTICE:.*CREATE TABLE will create partition ".*" for table ".*"/

# The following NOTICE is generated when creating a role. It is to inform the
# user that the database will assign the default resource queue to the role if
# the user has not explicitly specified one. Merging tests from postgres will
# cause the tests to output these messages and we would need to manually modify
# the corresponding expected output. Hence we want to ignore these.
m/^NOTICE:.*resource queue required -- using default resource queue ".*"/

# The following NOTICE is generated when a user creates an index on the parent
# partition table. For each child partition, it informs the user that the
# database will create an index for that parition. The messages might appear in
# different order for the child partitions.
m/^NOTICE:.*building index for child partition ".*"/

# The following NOTICE is generated when a user tries to split a partition or
# exchange a partition with the default partition.
# In case of split partitions we end up creating temp tables to exchange the partitions
# E.g exchanged partition "p1" of relation "parttest_t" with relation "pg_temp_4062621"
m/^NOTICE:.*exchanged partition ".*" with relation ".*"/

# The following NOTICE is generated when a user creates a table with no
# columns. E.g CREATE TABLE foo(). It is to inform the user that database
# cannot find any columns on which to distribute the data. Merging tests from
# postgres might cause the tests to output these messages and we would need to
# manually modify the corresponding expected output. Hence we want to ignore
# these.
m/^NOTICE:.*Table has no attributes to distribute on./

# The following NOTICE is generated when user runs ANALYZE. The NOTICE message
# generated seems to be non deterministic in that separate test runs produce
# the NOTICE for different tables and different number of tables. For E.g in one
# test run it produced the following NOTICE for pg_auth and in other it
# produced a NOTICE for pg_auth and pg_auth_constraints.
m/^NOTICE:.*ANALYZE detected all empty sample pages for table .*, please run VACUUM FULL for accurate estimation/

m/^WARNING:  could not close temporary file .*: No such file or directory/

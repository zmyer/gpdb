This directory exposes some ORCA functions as SQL-callable functions, to
make debugging and testing easier.

TODO: As of this writing, the regression tests don't work.

NOTE: Some of these are referenced by tests outside the GPDB repository,
in GPORCA's own repository. If you modify these, you may need to those tests
too!

This directory contains a GPDB cluster, created with version 4.3, for
upgrade purposes. It contains different kinds of tables, with different
datatypes and properties, to test that they can all be upgraded
successfully. The cluster has been created by the build-test-cluster.sql
script on 4.3.

FIXME: this test cluster have been built manually with initdb, not with
the official gpinit script. Some information related to clustering and
mirroring is not correctly set. When that begins to matter, you should
re-create the cluster properly!

NETBACKUP_PARAMS:
    # IMPORTANT: during testing, we found that if we used a dns name for
    # the netbackup host, that dns name should NOT be the same as the
    # internal name used by that host itself. In other words, on the
    # netbackup host itself, we gave localhost an alias in /etc/hosts of
    # 'netbackup-server', but thing failed if we used that same name
    # in clients also.
    NETBACKUP_SERVICE_HOST: netbackup-service
    NETBACKUP_POLICY: gpdb
    NETBACKUP_SCHEDULE: gpdb_schedule

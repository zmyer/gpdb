    @timestamp
    Scenario: gpcheckcat should use the same timestamp for creating repair dir and scripts

        And the user runs "psql timestamp_db -c "drop table if exists foo""
        Then the user runs "gpcheckcat timestamp_db"
        Then gpcheckcat should return a return code of 3
        Then the timestamps in the repair dir are consistent
        And the user runs "dropdb timestamp_db"
        And the path "gpcheckcat.repair.*" is removed from current working directory


    @persistent
    Scenario: gpcheckcat should report persistence errors # we need to run this test at the end because it makes the database go into a PANIC state.
        Given database "persistent_db" is dropped and recreated
